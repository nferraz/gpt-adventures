# GPT Adventure Game Engine

This script is a basic text adventure game engine that uses an AI language
model to generate game elements such as title, plot, descriptions,
and object names.

The basic structure is declared in a `GAME_TEMPLATE` dictionary that
defines the game's details such as objects and locations. The details are
generated by a LLM (GPT-3 by default).


## Playing

To play the game, the player must run the script, and they will be
prompted to interact with the game by typing commands. The game will
then respond to the player's commands with text generated by OpenAI's
GPT-3 language model.

The game engine includes the following default actions:

   * `look`: Describes the current location.
   * `look <object>`: Describes that object.
   * `take <object>`: Take an object if it is in the same room.
   * `drop <object>`: Drop an object if the player is carrying it.
   * `go <direction>`: Move to a different location in the game
(north/south/east/west).
   * `help`: Displays a list of possible actions.

**NEW**: the game engine will try to perform **any other action**
according to the game environment. The LLM will create a response and
modify the game structure accordingly. (See function: `magic_action`)


## Game Structure

The game structure object contains a title, plot and entities (player,
locations, and objects).

Each entity has a type, a position, a short description, and a long
description. Locations also have `exits` ("north", "south", "east",
"west").


## Modifying

The script can be extended by modifying the `GAME_TEMPLATE`, the prompts
or by adding additional game actions.
