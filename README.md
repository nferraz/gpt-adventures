# GPT Adventure Game Engine

This script is a basic text adventure game engine that uses an AI language
model to generate game elements such as title, plot, descriptions,
and object names.

The basic structure is declared in a `GAME_TEMPLATE` dictionary that
defines the game's details such as objects and locations. The details are
generated by a LLM (GPT-3 by default).

The game engine includes the following actions:

   * look: Describes the current location.
   * take <object>: Take an object if it is available.
   * drop <object>: Drop an object if they are carrying it.
   * go <direction>: Move to a different location in the game
(north/south/east/west).
   * help: Displays a list of possible actions that the player can take.

The `GAME_TEMPLATE` defines the structure of the game by including a title,
plot, entities (player, locations, and objects).

Each entity has a type, a position, a short description, and a long
description. The `GAME_TEMPLATE` also includes exits that are defined
for each location.

The auxiliar functions include:

   * `_list_exits_from(game, position)`: Lists the available exits from a
   given position.
   * `_list_objects_in(game, position)`: Lists the objects that are in a
   given position.
   * `_short_description(game, entity_name)`: Returns the short description
   of an entity.
   * `_long_description(game, entity_name)`: Returns the long description
   of an entity.

To play the game, the player must run the script, and they will be
prompted to interact with the game by typing commands. The game will
then respond to the player's commands with text generated by OpenAI's
GPT-3 language model.

The script can be extended by modifying the `GAME_TEMPLATE` and by adding
additional game actions.
